I AM IN BIG TROUBLE WITH MY VOXELAB AQUILA X2. I SCREWED UP THE SOFTWARE ON THAT TINY LITTLE CARD AND CANNOT GET IT BACK. I JUST HAVE A
BIG PAPERWEIGHT UNLESS I CAN PUT IN SOFTWARE THAT THE MACHINE UNDERSTANDS. I HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO FORMAT THAT LITTLE CARD. I TRIED TO PUT
BACK THE STUFF I SENT TO THE TRASH NOTHING WORKS. SO I WAS WATCHING THIS GUY ON YOUTUBE AND THATS HOW I GOT YOUR WEBSITE. HOPING YOU 
CAN HELP ME REPOPULATE THAT LITTLE CARD SO I CAN GET BACK TO MAKING STUFF WITH MY BRAND NEW 3D PRINTER. NOW WHAT DO I DO?
